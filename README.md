# ALU_CadenceDigital
The Design and Implementation of Arithmetic and Logic Unit is done and verified.Simulation (All the 16 different operations are verified in the waveform) , Synthesis-RTL schematic is obtained i.e. Netlist is the output of this step and Physical Design (PD) of the ALU is obtained with no errors. Timing Report can be obtained at each stage of the physical design from CTS (both pre-stage and post-stage)
